    "\n",
    "Now, it is time move on to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation! The first task you are asked to perform is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The first question to ask your boss is what exactly is the business objective; building a model is probably not the end goal. **How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?** This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, what algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The next question to ask is **what the current solution looks like (if any)**. It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.\n",

    "\n",
    "A `Pipeline` is useful for many reasons, including that they help prevent you from data leakage, i.e. disclosing some testing data in your training data. Objects that go into a scikit-learn `Pipeline` can either be _transformer_ or _estimator_ classes, or, if we use an imbalanced-learn `Pipeline` instead, also _resamplers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these objects (_resamplers_, _transformers_, and _estimator_) all typically have a `.fit()` method, which is used to\n",
    "- validate and interpret any parameters, \n",
    "- validate the input data, \n",
    "- estimate and store attributes from the parameters and provided data, \n",
    "- return the fitted estimator to facilitate method chaining in a pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with other sample properties (e.g. `sample_weight`), the `.fit()` method usually takes two inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The input matrix (or design matrix) X. The size of X is typically (n_samples, n_features), which means that samples are represented as rows and features are represented as columns.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - The target values y which are real numbers for regression tasks, or integers for classification (or any other discrete set of values). For unsupervized learning tasks, y does not need to be specified. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods available for these objects other than `.fit()` will depend on what they are, so we will look at each of these objects in turn and then combine them into a model pipeline later in this workshop."

For example, log transformations are useful for altering count data to have a more normal distribution as they pull in the more extreme high values relative to the median, while stretching back extreme low values away from the median. You can use a log transformation with either the pre-made `LogTransformer()` from `feature_engine.transformation`, or a custom function and `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer`.\n",

    "- If there are zero values, but no negative values, an option is to add a small number (e.g. 1) before carrying out the transformation, although if there are a large number of zero values then it is possible no Box-Cox transformation will sufficiently normalize the variable.\n",
